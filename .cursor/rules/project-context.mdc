# Alano Club Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a Django web application for Alano Club member management, replacing their existing desktop application with a web-based interface accessible from any device.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Django 4.2+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Package Manager**: UV (not pip)
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` 
- **Testing**: pytest (implementing)
- **Deployment**: Render (planned)

## Critical Setup Requirements

### Virtual Environment
**ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before any Python operations:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Package Management
**Use UV for all package operations:**
```bash
# Install packages
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add new packages
uv pip install package-name
```

### Database Connection
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Configuration**: Via `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL`
- **Connection**: Uses `dj-database-url` for Django integration

## Development Workflow Preferences

### Communication Style
1. **Always explain before executing** - Print out what you're going to do before doing it
2. **Show commands before running** - Display the exact command that will be executed
3. **Step-by-step approach** - Break complex tasks into simple, manageable steps
4. **Keep it simple** - Prefer straightforward solutions over complex ones

### Testing Approach
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-django
- **Philosophy**: Build tests as we develop features
- **Coverage**: Use pytest-cov for test coverage tracking

## Key Project Files
- `manage.py` - Django management commands
- `.env` - Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `members/` - Main app for member management
- `data/` - Excel/CSV data files for import

## Data Context
The project involves importing existing member data from Excel files:
- Member records (~325)
- Payment history (~1,337 records)
- Member types and payment methods
- Historical data and relationships

## Example Workflow
When implementing new features:
1. Explain what we're building
2. Show the command to be executed
3. Execute step by step
4. Test the implementation
5. Verify everything works before moving to next step
